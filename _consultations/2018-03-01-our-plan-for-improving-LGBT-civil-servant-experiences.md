## Consultation description

This week, we published [our plan for improving the experiences of LGBT+ civil servants: a consultation](/publication/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/). 

The consultation document sets out ideas for how the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance should evolve, and how its work should change. 

Our first action has been to change the name of our network to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. The rest is now up to you: tell us what you think about our ideas and what you'd like to see done differently.

You can respond either using the [online form]() or by [emailing us](info@civilservice.lgbt).
