BiSpace is a new initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate Bi Visibility Day, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace London

Come along to BEIS Conference Centre (Room C19) on 20 September at 12:30 to 14:00 in London. 

This will be a chilled “Lunch and Learn” style event where you can celebrate Bi Visibility Day, meet fellow bi, pan and queer civil servants, and take part in some informal facilitated sessions. 

Feel free to bring along your lunch and please sign up on the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bispace-london-tickets-49735592496) to make sure you’re on the list.
