Join us for our monthly a networking event in Manchester. 

This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

Our Manchester socials are on the second Thursday of each month.
