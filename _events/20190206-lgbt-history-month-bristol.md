Ofsted Rainbow Alliance (ORA) is running an event in collaboration with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network to celebrate LGBT History Month 2019.

The event will cover this year’s theme of ‘Peace, Activism and Reconciliation’ with sessions from various speakers throughout the day including:

- Grant Beresford from the Department for Transport, whose engaging talk on being the parent of a trans child was one of the highlights of the a:gender
conference in October 2018 (12pm)
- Cheryl Morgan from OutStories Bristol will be sharing the fascinating story of
Bristolian Michael Dillon, possibly the first trans man in the world to have a
phalloplasty (3pm)

There will be a bake sale at lunchtime (1-1:30pm) with all proceeds donated to an LGBT+ charity.

The event is taking place at the government offices at 2 Rivergate, Temple Quay in Bristol between 11am and 3:30pm. Civil servants from all departments are welcome, but please contact [lgbt@ofsted.gov.uk](mailto:lgbt@ofsted.gov.uk) from your Civil Service email account to gain access if you do not work at 2 Rivergate and bring your government ID/building pass for reception. You are welcome to attend as many of the sessions throughout the day as you like.

Our BiSpace meet up will also be taking place in Bristol at lunch time; register for [BiSpace on our website](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-02-06-bispace-bristol/). 

Both events will be followed by the [Civil Service LGBT+ Network South West’s monthly social](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-02-06-bristol-social/) at The Phoenix from 5pm.
