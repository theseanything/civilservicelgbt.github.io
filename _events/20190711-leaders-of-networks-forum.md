The Leaders of Networks Forum is a new regular event that will help shape the work of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and give the leaders of local LGBT+ networks a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.

The event is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network in a department, agency or arm's length body, or to anyone that volunteers with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network itself.

**To register your attendance, please email us in advance**. 

The agenda for the event will be published around one week in advance of the meeting. If you would like a specific item raised, or to present, please contact the organiser at the email address above.
