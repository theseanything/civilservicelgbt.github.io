An LGBT History Month event for civil servants - LGB&TI and Allies - hosted by Jonathan Slater, Civil Service LGB&TI Champion

All civil servants welcome. 

Learn about what the Civil Service has done to foster a more inclusive workplace for LGB&TI civil servants; and join in a discussion on what more needs to be done - and how.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
