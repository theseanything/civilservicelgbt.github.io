In honour of LGBT+ History Month, join us for a bi+ and LGBT+ themed quiz night, with the chance to win some cool prizes!

No need to sign up - we'll be at a table with a BiSpace sign. The reservation will be under Astrid.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
