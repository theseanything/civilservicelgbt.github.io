Join BiSpace's usual monthly social, although this one will be on Zoom! This is an informal afterwork social, and a chance to get some much-needed social interaction in.

As we all adjust to life in lockdown, we're thinking of new ways to stay in touch. We're experimenting with this virtual social, so please let us know how you find it and if we should make them more regular.

Pets, drinks and TV show recommendations are all very welcome!



**What is BiSpace?**

BiSpace is a social initiative run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. This is facilitated by the Bi+ Inclusion Team under the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

The term 'bi+' encompasses bisexual, asexual, pansexual, queer and other similar identities.



**How do I join?**

Please register your interest on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bispace-virtual-social-tickets-102704544056) using your work email. You will be contacted with the Zoom joining details.



**Can't make this one but still interested?**

No worries! We do socials on a monthly basis (and may do more regularly during lockdown), so there will be more opportunities in the weeks to come.



**Questions?**
