The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) are joining forces to run an inaugural LGBT+ event. The event will highlight the barriers to LGBT+ staff succeeding in the workplace and aim to raise awareness of how their friends and colleagues can support them.
The event brings together a wide-range of speakers:

- HSE, ONR, and external organisation staff will each reflect on their career and how being LGBT+ has shaped and influenced it; 
- Prospect trade unionâ€™s national LGBT+ network organiser presenting on the real and current issues LGBT+ staff face in the workplace; and
- Stonewall will give the audience the benefit of its long experience and advice on how to be an ally. 

Attendees will be able to enjoy refreshments during the intermission, purchase a slice of cake (with all proceeds going to an LGBT+ charity), and take advantage of the stalls run by the Prospect and PCS trade unions where advice and material on supporting LGBT+ colleagues will be available.

The event is taking place between 10:00 and 13:00 on the 31st October at the HSE/ONR offices of Redgrave Court in Bootle, Merseyside. Civil servants are welcome to take advantage of any spare places and attend. Bookings can be made by contacting the [HSE/ONR LGBT network](mailto:LGBT@hse.gov.uk).
