As part of LGBT+ History Month, the Cabinet Office has gathered a panel of Civil Servants from a variety of departments and grades who have an LGBT+ identity that ‘intersects’ across ethnicity, gender, disability and age and more. We will also hear some powerful stories from LGBT+ allies. 

If you’re a Civil Servant that identifies with these topics, an LGBT+ ally, or just want to learn more about how intersectionality has shaped the careers of our panellists, we would love for you to join this open dialogue about existing on the intersection in the Civil Service. With an opening and support from newly appointed LGBT+ Champion David Quarrey, we plan to increase awareness of the lived experiences of our friends and colleagues.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
