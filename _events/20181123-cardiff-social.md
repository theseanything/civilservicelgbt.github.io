Join us for a networking and social event in Cardiff. This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It’s usually free to attend.

**Not based in Cardiff?** Don’t worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don’t have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
