Join us for our monthly a networking event in London. This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Each month we're somewhere different - just to keep things interesting. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

Please email [Matthew Walker](mailto:MATTHEW.WALKER1@dwp.gsi.gov.uk) if you need a contact number for the day.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
