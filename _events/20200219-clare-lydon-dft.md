The DfT LGBT+ committee is pleased to announce that lesbian author Clare Lydon will be joining us for a talk. Clare has penned the ‘London Calling’ series as well as stand-alone novels like ‘Once Upon a Princess’ and her books have been described as hallmark romantic comedies with a lesbian twist.  

Don’t miss the chance to come and hear an LGBT+ author talk about her experiences, and take the opportunity to ask any questions you may have as well as pick up a new book or two! 

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
