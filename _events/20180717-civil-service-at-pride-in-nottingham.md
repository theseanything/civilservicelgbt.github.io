Come and join the Civil Service in Nottingham when we again take in Pride on 28 July 2018.

Please [contact David Wilson](mailto:DAVID.WILSON1@dwp.gsi.gov.uk) if you would like to take part, either by [email](mailto:DAVID.WILSON1@dwp.gsi.gov.uk) or [by phone](tel:+4477950362556).

The meeting point is Castle Gate at 11:00am on the day. When everyone has arrived, we will move off to the starting point in the parade.

Please wear Civil Service t-shirts or uniforms. David has some spares, or you can [contact us](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) and we can try to organise one for you in the post.
