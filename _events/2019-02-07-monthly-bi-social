Join us for a monthly social event, run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. It is a chance to meet fellow bisexual, queer, pansexual and asexual civil servants over a cup of tea or glass of wine (completely up to you - this venue does both!)

We operate on a "no-assumptions" basis, welcoming anyone under the "bi umbrella" without assuming someone's preferred pronoun, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

This venue is a chilled café/bar with sofas and comfy seats, hot drinks, snacks and alcohol. It has gender-neutral toilets and is an accessible venue (ground floor, two small steps from the street, with a lift for wheelchair users). If you have any questions or suggestions on how I can make this event accessible to you, please contact me on mary.peart@civilservice.lgbt. 

Mary Peart, our Bi Lead, [looks like this](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marypeart/) and if you can’t find her, text 07899954623 on the night.

We will run this event every month on the same evening as the monthly [CS LGBT+ Network drinks](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018-12-06-london-social/) in Soho and we can go there afterwards.
