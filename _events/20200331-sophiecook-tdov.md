Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV) is an annual event which is dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising awareness of the discrimination faced by the trans community worldwide.

To mark the occasion, the Enviroment Agency LGBT+ Network will be hosting a talk by writer, speaker, activist and broadcaster Sophie Cook via YouTube live streaming.  Sophie will talk about her personal story, vulnerability and building resilience.  It will take place from 12-1pm on Tuesday 31 March and promises to be a great event, so please save the date.  

To find out more about Sophie, please visit her [website](http://www.sophiecook.me.uk/).

If you are interested, please follow the below steps: 

Go to @sophiecooktalks via Twitter shortly before midday on Tuesday 31 March, where Sophie Cook will put a link to a live streaming application called Periscope. This should be viewable on any device.

There will be the opportunity to ask Sophie written questions live but please note that if you are using a mobile phone you will need to install the Periscope application ahead of time. We are told this is not required on a PC.
