*Please note: we're trialling a new time/venue this month - feedback welcome.*

Join us for a monthly social event run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. It is a chance to meet fellow bisexual, queer, pansexual and asexual civil servants in a relaxed venue. We can then head to the wider CS LGBT+ social afterwards.

No need to sign up - just add it to your diary and then turn up on the day. Do not hesitate to email <mary.peart@civilservice.lgbt> if you have any questions.
