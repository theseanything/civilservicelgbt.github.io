Following the success of the Cabinet Office LGBT+ Network's Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual (LGB) women's listening circle, we would like to hold another listening circle about gender identity. The LGB women discussion was invaluable to us as network leads to hear about the intersection of gender and sexual orientation, and we are already adapting some of our ways of working and have a volunteer who is our link between our network and the gender equality group, to ensure LGB women's voices are heard in both networks. 
 
The gender identity listening circle is a way for us to talk through our experience in the workplace, any barriers you feel are in your way to bringing your whole self to work, and anything we can do to help colleagues. 
 
***The format***

Listening circles are always held by Google Hangouts so that we can hide the guest list for people who would like to remain anonymous on the call. If anyone would like to remain anonymous, we ask that you dial into the listening circle instead of using the Hangouts login. On the call, we will ask you your preferred pronoun. We will capture the discussion on a virtual whiteboard but names will not be recorded. 
 
If you would like to join the hangout, please contact the organiser by [email](mailto:keela.shackell-smith@cabinetoffice.gov.uk).
