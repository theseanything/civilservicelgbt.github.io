With a special thanks to Spirit, the MoJ's LGBT+ network, who have taken the lead and got everything organised, registration for the cross-government LGBT+ History Month Quiz is now open.

For teams based outside London, there will also be the option to take part remotely.

For those who wish to attend, but are unable to get a team together, please come along and a team will be sorted for you - this worked really well at last year's Pride Quiz Night.

Please register by **25 February.**

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
