This year, to mark LGBT+ History Month, join Dame Sue Owen, DCMS Permanent Secretary and Straight Ally for the Civil Service, in conversation with Chris Smith, Baron of Finsbury.

Chris is a peer in the House of Lords, and was formerly the first ever Secretary of State at DCMS. He was the first openly gay male British MP, coming out in 1984, and in 2005, the first MP to acknowledge that he is HIV positive.

On Valentines Day, join Sue and Chris as they reflect together on how far we have come in the UK on LGBT+ equality, diversity and inclusion, and what more there is to do in the future.

Organised by the DCMS LGBT+ Network.
