Join us as we march in the parade at MardiGla in Glasgow.

Last year around 200 Civil Servants proudly marched through the streets of Glasgow for the parade and we would like to see a good turnout too this year, to support our LGBT+ colleagues and the wider community.

## Date

The parade takes place on Saturday 20th July 2019. 

## Meeting points and times

We will assemble at Kelvingrove Park from 11:30am. The march starts at 12:00pm prompt. 

Please look out for the banners.

## Route

We will make our way through the City Centre up to George Square and then disperse into Merchant City where the MardiGla festival will take place.
