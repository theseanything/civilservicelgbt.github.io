Are you transgender, non-binary, gender fluid or genderqueer? Are you intersex or have an intersex condition or variation in sex characteristics?

Please join the Government Equalities Office and Cabinet Office for a cross-gov virtual meeting on Thursday 16 April, 2 - 3pm, facilitating a conversation about how Covid-19 and self-isolation have impacted you.

The objective of this initiative is to support trans, non-binary and intersex staff across the Civil Service, and it may become a series of online meetings, discussions and activities.

If you donâ€™t identify as trans, non-binary or intersex yourself, but you are in a position of supporting colleagues who are (through Diversity and Inclusion roles or as a line-manager), you are very welcome to join the conversation. 

This will be hosted on Google Hangouts, but will also have dial-in options via a telephone number and pin. 

Email suzanne.van-rossenberg@geo.gov.uk to receive the calendar invitation and dial-in details.

In the meeting, we will follow the Chatham House Rule: all participants are asked to not attribute any information shared by participants to their identity and affiliation outside the meeting.

We are mindful that not everyone can or may want to join the meeting. Your personal experience with Covid-19, self-isolation and working from home can be shared directly with the CO Diversity and Inclusion team via email: keela.shackell-smith@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.

Do you have a digital event coming up, or want to plan one? [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
