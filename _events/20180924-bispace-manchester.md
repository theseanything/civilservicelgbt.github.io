BiSpace is a new initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate Bi Visibility Day, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace London

Come along to Piccadilly Gate (room 1.06) on 24 September at 12:30 to 14:00 in London. 

This will be a chilled lunch time event to meet fellow bi, pan and queer civil servants over lunch time and celebrate Bi Visibility Day.

Feel free to bring along your lunch and please sign up on the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bispace-manchester-tickets-49735606538) to make sure youâ€™re on the list.
