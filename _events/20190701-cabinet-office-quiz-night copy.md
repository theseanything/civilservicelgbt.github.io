After the success of last year's Pride Quiz Night, which teams from across government took part in, the Cabinet Office LGBT+ Network is delighted to be hosting another quiz night in the run up to Pride in London.

Simply get yourselves into teams of up to six people, come up with a witty name based on your workplace and LGBT+ and [register](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pride-quiz-night-tickets-62710849840).

For those of you who would like to take part, but are struggling to get a team together, please select 'individual registration' and we'll get something sorted.

There is no cap on the number of teams each department can submit and it is open to everyone, including our allies - questions on Madonna and Ru Paul will be kept to an absolute minimum.

The event is going to be held in the canteen of 1 Horse Guards Road.

Last year, the event was an opportunity to raise money for charity, which is something we will look to do again. Therefore, there will be a suggested donation of £3 per person. Details of the charity will be confirmed.

Things you need to know:

- Teams of up to six people
- The quiz will start at 6.30pm, so please arrive from 6pm to ensure your team is set up
- Bring your own drinks and food (wine, beer and cider = ok, absinthe and tequila = not ok)
- £3 suggested donation to charity (TBC)
