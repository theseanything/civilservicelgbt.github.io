On Thursday 27th September from 5:30pm to 7:00pm, the Cabinet Office Ethnic Diversity Programme will host the next instalment of our #IfiICanYouCan Senior Speaker Series, inpartnership with the SCS Race to the Top network.

Our ‘Championing Race’ Question Time session, will take place in 1 Horse Guards Road, HM Treasury and will focused on the role of a Race Champion, bringing together:

- **Richard Heaton** — Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Justice and Clerk of the Crown in Chancery who has served as Race Champion for the Civil Service for over 4 years.

-  **Selvin Brown** — Director of Engagement and Policy at the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Diversity & Inclusion Champion at the Government Communication Service and Deputy Race Champion for the Civil Service

Their shared commitment to race equality is practically expressed through their daily duties as leading Civil Service Race Champions. Both Richard and Selvin:

- convene with other race champions from across the Civil Service to share and promote best practice
- actively promote and advocate for ethnic minority leaders across the Civil Service
- champion the development of ethnically diverse talent pools
- actively participate in and drive talent programmes
- actively engage with departmental and cross-government networks

Our Panellists will be put under the spotlight to answer any questions you have about their respective roles as Head and Deputy Civil Service Race Champions. And will in turn shed light on the work they do, striving to make the Civil Service, serve you!
