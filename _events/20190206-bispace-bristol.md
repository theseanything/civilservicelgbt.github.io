BiSpace -- our initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants -- is back. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate LGBT History Month, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace Bristol

Come along to the second BiSpace event held in Bristol to meet fellow bisexual, queer, pansexual and asexual civil servants. BiSpace is a wider initiative run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants

Meet Em, our host, at Veeno at 12:30 on the 6th February. This will be a relaxed lunch time event to celebrate LGBT History Month. Veeno is technically a wine bar but also a nice spot to get soft drinks and food (e.g. around £6 for a panini/sandwich).
