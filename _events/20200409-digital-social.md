With all 'physical' socials suspended, we are missing our network family. 

Join us on Thursday 9th April at 18:30 for our very first digital LGBT+ quiz. 

This quiz is open to all network members and allies. You do not need a team as the technology of Zoom will allow us to create virtual ones. 

While our socials usually take place in different locations across the country, this digital social will be the opportunity to virtually meet members from far and wide. 

Joining instructions will be sent out in advance of the event to those registered. If you are unable to participate vocally, please let us know and we will make sure you can still join in safely. 

Please sign up for the event, using the above [link](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/civil-service-lgbt-network-digital-quiz-tickets-101877147290?ref=elink). 

Do you have a digital event coming up, or want to plan one? [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
