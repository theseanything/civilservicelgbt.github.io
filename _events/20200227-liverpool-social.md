Join us for our monthly a networking event in Liverpool. 

This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

Our Liverpool socials are on the forth Thursday of each month.

Please contact [Ross Starkie](mailto:ross.starkie@hmrc.gov.uk) if you need more information.

**Not based in Liverpool?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website. 
 
If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
