Join us for our monthly a networking event in Manchester. 

This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

Our Manchester socials are on the second Tuesday of each month.

Please contact [Matthew Walker](mailto:MATTHEW.WALKER1@DWP.GSI.GOV.UK)  if you need more information.

> **Not based in Manchester?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

> If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
