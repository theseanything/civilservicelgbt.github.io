Join us as we march in the parade at Pride in London.

## How to register

Places in this year's Civil Service group for Pride in London are limited. We will allocate places in the parade via a lottery 6 to 8 weeks prior to the event.

You can register in the lottery to attend by [completing this registration form](https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9).

We will use the information you provide to send you details for the event and to monitor the diversity of our group.

We aim to send confirmation of your place in late May, and final event information to you around 2 weeks before the event.
