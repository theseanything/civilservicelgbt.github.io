The DfT LGBT+ committee is pleased to host a screening of 'My beautiful Launderette'.

My Beautiful Laundrette was one of the first movies created by Film4; it features an inter-racial LGBT relationship at the heart of its story. Set in London and exploring a range of societal issues that impact the LGBT community in the city, we thought it would be a perfect piece of diverse and inclusive cinema to show as part of LGBT History Month.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
