Join us as the Civil Service participates in the march through Leicester to celebrate Pride. 

The march starts at 12:00. Weâ€™ll meet at Curve Theatre, Leicester, at 11:30 before the march starts. 

The march finishes in Victoria Park, where we will undoubtedly get something to eat and have a few drinks. 

Please bring and wear either a CSRA / Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, or a t-shirt from your own LGBT+ Network.
