Please come and join us, and our Women Together Network on Friday March 8th from 12 noon to 2pm in Caerdydd 1 and 2, Cathays park, Cardiff

Cindy will be with us to talk to us about the highs and lows of the women’s events on International Women’s Day.

Cindy is the founder & festival director of L Fest, the UK’s only lesbian festival, Cindy set up L Fest in 2011 and now in its 9th year it has gone from 250 guests to over 1000 women enjoying a weekend festival. Within the success of L Fest, L Fest del Mar was born in south east Spain and has also seen success for the last 6 years, enabling women to experience a holiday surrounded by LGBT women.

Cindy has more recently set up a farm barn wedding venue with partner Beki and they are home to 20 weddings per year.

International Women's Day is annually held on March 8 to celebrate women's achievements throughout history and across nations. It is also known as the United Nations (UN) Day for Women's Rights and International Peace.

The International Women's Day 2019 campaign theme of #BalanceforBetter is a call-to-action for driving gender balance across the world. How will you help make a difference?
