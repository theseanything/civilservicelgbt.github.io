Bi Visibility Day (23rd September) is just around the corner. To celebrate, join us at BiSpace London over lunchtime on Friday 4th October.

BiSpace is a chance for bi+ civil servants to meet up and share your experiences. So many LGBT events are often designed with the "G" and the "L" in mind. However, this is a space for those who identify with other minority sexual identities, such as bi, pan, queer or asexual.

It will be facilitated in order to create an accepting space and encourage discussion. However, it will be pretty informal - please feel free to bring along your lunch.

Arrive promptly at 12:30 to be collected at Home Office reception, and you'll be escorted to G47 in Fry Building (MHCLG building).
