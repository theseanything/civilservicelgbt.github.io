sh..OUT are delighted to be hosting an event to celebrate LGBT+ History Month at the National Army Museum on Thursday 21st February, from 1800 to 2000.

LGBT History Month is a month-long annual observance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history, and the history of the gay rights and related civil rights movements. LGBT History Month provides role models, builds community, and represents a civil rights statement about the contributions of the LGBT community.

We will be hosting a series of talks, including Chris Park who will deliver a talk on Polari and the development of homosexual language and its role in society. Chris is a retired Civil Servant who, for the last 10 years of his service, worked for the Ministry of Justice and led the Rainbow network, and was also a founding member and first Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network (formerly Civil Service Rainbow Alliance).

We will also have the MOD LGBT+ Champion Jacqui Rock, talking about her experience as an ally and how the MOD will deliver on it's pledge of reaching 5000 LGBT+ allies by 2020.
