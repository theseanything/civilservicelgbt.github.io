BiSpace -- our initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants -- is back. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate LGBT History Month, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace Manchester

Join us for the second BiSpace event in Manchester, run by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. It is a chance to meet fellow bisexual, queer, pansexual and asexual civil servants. We will meet at 5.30 at the Molly House, a relaxed venue where you can get hot drinks, alcohol, and/or snacks and meals.

At 7.30pm round the corner at the LGBT Foundation, BiPhoria will be holding their [monthly bisexual social-support group](https://www.biphoria.org.uk/diary/). Feel free to head there together afterwards!
