Join us for our monthly a networking event in Manchester. 

From 6-7pm, we will get 10% discount at the venue. From there we will go on to an activity or the village.

This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

Our Manchester socials are on the second Tuesday of each month.

Please contact [Matthew Walker](mailto:MATTHEW.WALKER1@DWP.GOV.UK)  if you need more information.

**Not based in Manchester?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
