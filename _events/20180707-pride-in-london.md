Join us as we march in the parade at Pride in London.

**You must reserve a place to join the parade**. There are up to 200 places available.

You can register up to 2 tickets; one for you, and one for a friend. To ensure all places are fairly allocated, it will not be possible to register large groups, or on behalf of an entire network as part of this process.

Reservations will happen in 2 waves:

- the first will start at 10:00am on Tuesday 1 May.
- the second will start at 10:00am on Monday 14 May.

If you are unsuccessful in securing a ticket, you can join a waiting list. If more tickets become available, then you will be sent an email to take their place. You will have 24 hours to respond before your place is allocated to the next person on the list.
