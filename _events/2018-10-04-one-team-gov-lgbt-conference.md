excerpt: DWPride is hosting OneTeamGov LGBT* on Thursday 11 October.
---
DWP's LGBT Network - DWPride - and [One Team Gov](https://www.oneteamgov.uk/) are working together to host a one day event on 11 October aimed at LGBT inclusion in the Civil Service.

The themes for the day are around sharing best practice and practical actions. We’ve got an amazing line up of speakers and interactive break-out sessions planned, bringing together a range of colleagues from LGBT* networks across the Civil Service, government and beyond.

The event will take place on National Coming Out day -- a fantastic opportunity to show our solidarity and spread our message.

If you’re an LGBT* champion in government and would be interested in coming along, we still have a few spaces remaining so [register for a place now](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/one-team-gov-lgbt-tickets-47708592685).
