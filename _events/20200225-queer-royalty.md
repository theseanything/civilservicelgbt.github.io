As part of LGBT History Month, the DCMS LGBT+ Network is delighted to be welcoming Matthew Storey, Curator at Historic Royal Palaces (a DCMS ALB), for a lunchtime talk. He will be sharing his research on queer love in the Royal Palaces. The talk is open to all civil servants who have CTC clearance or above - we hope to see you there!
