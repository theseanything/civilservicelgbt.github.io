Come and join the Welsh Government and Civil Service in Cardiff when we again take a stand at Pride Cymru – on 25 August and 26 August. You can also take your place in the fabulous annual Parade on the Saturday, 25 August.

Pride Cymru’s Big Weekend 2018 will provide 3 days of pure party atmosphere and extravagant entertainment in the heart of the capital. It will be celebrating  and promoting the importance of LGBT in the community as well as bringing more than 200,000 people together in celebration in Wales’ capital city.
