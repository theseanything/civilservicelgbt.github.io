## Free [online](https://film.britishcouncil.org/about/work/fivefilmsforfreedom) untill 29th March 2020.

Support our creative friends during this difficult time by getting involved with the British Council’s and BFI Flare’s London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival: #FiveFilmsForFreedom. 

**From the British Council:** Every year the British Council, in partnership with BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival, invite audiences around the world to watch five films online for free in solidarity with LGBTIQ+ communities in places where freedom and equal rights are limited. 

In this continuing creative partnership, the British Council makes five short films from the BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival available across the British Council’s global digital networks, free of charge, from 18 - 29 March 2020. 

The films are made available during these 12 days only and this year the films come from Brazil, Ireland, Norway and the UK. 
This year’s film makers explore compelling LGBTIQ+ realities, from navigating family relationships to the struggle for and celebration of sexual freedom. Global audiences are encouraged to show solidarity with LGBTIQ+ communities around the world by watching the films on the British Council’s Youtube Arts channel.

While BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival has been cancelled, the digital-only plan to share five of those films through Five Films for Freedom is still going ahead.
