BiSpace is a new initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate Bi Visibility Day, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace Bristol

Come along to Horizon House canteen on 20 September at 12:30 to 14:00 in Bristol. 

This will be a chilled lunch time event to meet fellow bi, pan, queer civil servants and celebrate Bi Visibility Day.

Feel free to bring along your lunch and please sign up on the [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bispace-bristol-tickets-49735716868) to make sure youâ€™re on the list.
