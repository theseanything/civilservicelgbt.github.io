The Bi+ Inclusion Team, a working group within the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, will be holding a virtual workshop and discussion on ways to be bisexual and visible at work.

Bisexual people are often assumed to be straight or gay/lesbian based on the gender of their partner, which means their identity is erased. The workshop is there for people to share their experiences of coming out at work and for people who would like to be more visible to discuss ways of achieving this.

The workshop will be facilitated via Zoom. You do not need an account to take part. Please register your interest on Eventbrite, and then Zoom joining details will be circulated to you closer to the date.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please email Alan.Edwards@sfo.gov.uk or Astrid.Crowley1@homeoffice.gov.uk
