Join us for our monthly a networking event in London. This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Each month we're somewhere different - just to keep things interesting. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It's usually free to attend.

**Not based in London?** Don't worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don't have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! [Contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we can help you promote it.
