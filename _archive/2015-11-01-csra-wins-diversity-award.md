The <a href="http://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/">Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards</a> were last month. Congratulations to Ollie Entwistle and Kate Scott-Hughes who won the “Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender People Award”!

The “Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender People Award” recognises an individual or team for making a real difference by improving the work experience and engagement levels of LGB&amp;T colleagues.

Ollie and Kate were recognised for their tremendous efforts in raising the issues that impact on civil servants who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other (LGBT).

In the last year, Ollie has led in organising the Civil Service wide conference on LGBT issues – organising speakers and facilitating the day. Ollie also played a crucial role in the development of Ben Summerskill’s report, “Don’t ask, don’t tell”. He developed an effective relationship with Ben, who was able to test his emerging findings and recommendations with Ollie in a confidential way.

Kate played a crucial role in the development of the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide by using her networks to attract a broad range of role models. This enabled LGBT civil servants from across the UK, to be included. Kate also played a leading role in organising the Civil Services’ participation in 8 Pride events.

In response to winning the award, Ollie said:

“I was delighted to win the award with my Vice-Chair Kate for our work leading CSRA. CSRA plays a crucial role in representing and supporting LGBT civil servants across the country. In the past year we published the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide, we organised a conference on LGBT equality, and we played a crucial role in the development of Ben Summerskill’s report “Don’t ask, don’t tell” which provided a “warts ‘n’ all” assessment of the experience of LGBT civil servants. Kate and I might have led from the front in delivering all of this but we were supported by an excellent team of volunteers, so, for me, this award is also for the whole CSRA team.”

Ollie and Kate have also been invited to attend the Civil Service Awards on 12 November at Buckingham Palace, as they have been shortlisted for the Diversity and Inclusion Award which will be presented at that event.
