Today Stonewall has released [the results of the 2017 Workplace Equality Index](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/get-involved/workplace/workplace-equality-index). The index is an annual ranking of the top 100 most LGBT-inclusive organisations in the country.


Like previous years, many Civil Service organisations have submitted themselves to be part of of the index. Once again, Civil Service agencies and non-departmental bodies have excelled in the Index. 


Every agency and departmental body that featured in the Index last year has featured in it again, and many have increased their position relative to last year. GCHQ and the Scottish Government joined those agencies in the top 100 too, bringing the total number of Civil Service organisations in the Top 100 to 11, up from 9 last year. 


The Home Office, having previously ranked in the Top 10 organisations for 3 out of 5 consecutive years, retains its Star Performer status this year too.


CSRA would like to congratulate all the organisations that have placed in the Top 100 or achieved Star Performer status.
