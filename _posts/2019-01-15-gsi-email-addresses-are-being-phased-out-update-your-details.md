You might be aware that government email addresses that end in *.gsi.gov.uk* -- sometimes referred to as "GSI" emails -- are being phased out and replaced with just *gov.uk* email addresses.

Individual departments are making the changes at their own pace, but at some point in the near future email address that end in *.gsi.gov.uk* will no longer receive emails. If you signed up for our newsletter using your GSI email address, you will need to update your details.

## How to update your email address

If you are already registed with your GSI email address, visit the [update your profile](/update-profile) page and input your existing details. 

A message box will appear below the form (ignore any errors you see). In the message box will be a link that says "Click here to update your profile". Select that link: it will send you an email with a final link to our mailing list system where you can change your email address.

If this doesn't work, you can simply [re-register from scratch](/join-us) with your new email, and unsubscribe at your old email address. A link to unsubscribe is included at the bottom of every email we send you.

## Getting two sets of newsletters already?

If you're already receiving two newsletters, it's because you've signed up with both your GSI and your non-GSI email address. You can unsubscribe using the links at the bottom of the emails.
