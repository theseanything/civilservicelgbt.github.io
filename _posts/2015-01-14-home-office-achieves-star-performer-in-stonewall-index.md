The Home Office has achieved ‘Star Performer’ status in a Workplace Equality Index compiled by Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity.

The ranking was awarded in recognition of the fact that the Home Office has consistently been in the top ten of the <a href="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_work/stonewall_top_100_employers/">Stonewall Workplace Equality Index</a> (WEI) over the last five years. The WEI lists the top 100 employers based on an annual benchmarking exercise using Stonewall’s criteria as a model for good practice.

## Top 10

Taking part in the WEI is an effective way to measure employers’ efforts to tackle discrimination and create an inclusive workplace for lesbian, gay and bisexual employees.

The 2014 WEI saw the Home Office achieve joint fifth place with Ernst &amp; Young (EY) out of 369 employers. The Home Office was the highest scoring government department and third out of 200 public sector organisations who took part in 2014. Employers were assessed against eight evaluation criteria, including a staff feedback questionnaire for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) employees.

## Pushing for equality

Mike Anderson, Home Office champion for sexual orientation, said, ‘It is a great privilege to be offered Star Performer status, especially as we are the only government department in the eight organisations who have attained this status.

‘It will give us more chance to focus on LGBT objectives throughout everything we deliver as a department and to push hard for equality for LGBT staff and people who deal directly with the Home Office, for example, those seeking asylum. We have work to do to meet these challenging objectives.’

Ian Harris, chair of <a href="https://horizon.fcos.gsi.gov.uk/section/hr-and-learning/staff-support-networks-and-unions/spectrum">Spectrum</a>, the Home Office network for LGBT staff, said:  “Star Performer status will hopefully give us a renewed impetus to push for LGBT equality in the workplace and to serve as an inspirational example to other organisations.”
