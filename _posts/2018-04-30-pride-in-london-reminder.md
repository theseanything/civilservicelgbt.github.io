This is a reminder that reservations to join our parade group at Pride in London open tomorrow, 1st May 2018, at 10:00am.

We have been allocated 120 places in the parade, and we also intend to have a large float as part of the event.

You can register up to 2 tickets; one for you, and one for a friend.

Reservations will happen in 2 waves:

1. the first will start tomorrow at 10:00am on Tuesday 1 May.
2. the second will start at 10:00am on Monday 14 May.

If you are unsuccessful in securing a ticket, you can join a waiting list. If more tickets become available, then you will be sent an email to take their place. You will have 24 hours to respond before your place is allocated to the next person on the list.

[To register, please visit this Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/civil-service-at-pride-in-london-registration-44344963981?aff=cslgbtwebsite).

All reservations also allow you to attend our post-parade social. The venue for this is still to be confirmed.
