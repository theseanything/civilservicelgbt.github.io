The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** is run entirely by volunteers. It's thanks to them that we can host our socials, run our conferences and keep the pressure on the Civil Service to do the right things for you. 

We've just published [our business plan](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/) for the next 2 years. It sets out what we're trying to achieve between now and December 2020. To deliver it, we're going to need your help.

We're looking for people who can spare a few hours every month to help us do our work. Below are some of the roles we are looking to fill. **If you're interested, please email us at [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).**
