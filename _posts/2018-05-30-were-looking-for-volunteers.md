The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** is run entirely by volunteers. It's thanks to them that we can host our socials, run our conferences and keep the pressure on the Civil Service to do the right things for you. 

We've just published [our business plan](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/) for the next 2 years. It sets out what we're trying to achieve between now and December 2020. To deliver it, we're going to need your help.

We're looking for people who can spare a few hours every month to help us do our work. Below are some of the roles we are looking to fill. **If you're interested, please email us at [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).**

## Roles available

- [Blog editor](#blog-editor)
- [Social media manager](#social-media-manager)

## Blog editor

**Are you good with words?** We're looking for someone who can manage the blog on our website. 

You'll be asked to produce or find blog posts each month on timely topics. That might be for an important date in the calendar — like LGBT History Month or Bi Visibility Day — or for a particular topic we want to highlight — like Pride.

## Social media manager

**Do you know how to build a following?** We're looking for someone to manage our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.

You'll be asked to keep our feeds filled with the things we're doing, like highlighting our events or publicising our blog posts.
