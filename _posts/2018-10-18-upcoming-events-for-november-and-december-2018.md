There are a number of events coming up before Christmas -- some of which are in new places, thanks to local networks and volunteers. We thought it would be helpful to highlight come of them, so here's an update on the events coming up over the next few months.

## LGBT+ in the workplace: success and struggles

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) are joining forces to run an inaugural LGBT+ event. The event will highlight the barriers to LGBT+ staff succeeding in the workplace and aim to raise awareness of how their friends and colleagues can support them. 

The event is on 31 October 2018 at Redgrave Court, Bootle, Merseyside. If you'd like to go, contact [the event organisers](LGBT@hse.gov.uk).
