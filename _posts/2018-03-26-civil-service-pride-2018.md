**The Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be organising the Civil Service's participation in Pride events across the UK again this year.** This blog post is to let you know what we've organised so far, how you can take part, and how you can help organise for your own local Pride.

## Where we're planning to take part

As usual, we are planning to take part in multiple Pride events this year. So far we have started planning for:

- [**Pride in London**](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/08/25/pride-in-london/), 7 July 2018: we have a float and 120 places confirmed
- [**Pride Cymru, Cardiff**](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/08/25/pride-cymru-cardiff/), 25 August and 26 August 2018: the Welsh Government will be leading a parade group on 25 August, and a stall on both days

Thanks to the work of our regional organisers, we also expect to take part in Pride events in Nottingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

[a:gender](http://www.agender.org.uk) are also planning to take part in the [Sparkle Weekend](https://www.sparkle.org.uk/sparkle-in-the-park) in Manchester between 6 July 2018 and 8 July 2018.

> If you would like to organise a Civil Service group as part of Pride in your local area, please [get in contact with us](/about/contact-us/).

## T-shirts

We will be making new t-shirts for this year’s Pride events. We are attempting to provide these free of charge to people who join our Pride groups. If this isn’t possible for some reason, t-shirts are likely to cost between £15 and £20.

More details will be released soon.

## Pride in London

**You must register to join our group in the parade.** All places have now been filled, but you can join our waiting list; as spaces become available, we'll add more people to the parade.

For more information, please [visit the event page on our website](/event/2018/07/07/pride-in-london/).
