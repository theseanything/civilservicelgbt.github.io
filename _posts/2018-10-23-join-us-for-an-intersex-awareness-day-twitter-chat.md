Intersex Awareness Day is observed on 26 October each year. It's a chance to celebrate people who are born intersex, and to highlight the issues they face in their every day lives.

This year, we're teaming up with [a:gender](https://www.agender.org.uk) and hosting a Twitter chat to mark the event. 

## What is a Twitter chat?

A Twitter chat is where a group of Twitter users log on at a chosen time to tweet and discuss a certain topic. We'll be using the hashtag **#CSIAD**.

We'll post a series of questions -- labelled Q1, Q2, and so on -- and you send back your thoughts and comments as answers -- using A1, A2, and so on. 

## How can I take part?

We'll be hosting the chat on our Twitter page, [@cslgbt](https://twitter.com/cslgbt), between 6:00pm and 7:00pm on Intersex Awareness Day, 26 October 2018. 

Just log on to Twitter and reply to our #CSIAD tweets -- it's that simple!
