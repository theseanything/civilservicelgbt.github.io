excerpt: Here's what we got up to in the Pride in London celebrations last weekend.

On 7 July 2018, we took part in Pride in London's annual celebrations and parade. This year was our best yet. 

## Our best group yet -- and the most in demand

This year, we had 120 civil servants join us in the parade. More than 2,000 people tried to get a place in the group this year: and we had hundreds on our waiting list for extra places.

We also had, for the first time in more than 5 years, a float as part of our parade group.

We are delighted that so many people want to take part in our London parade groups. Unfortunately, due to restrictions put in place by Pride in London to ensure safety on the day, it's not possible for everyone to be part of our group, but we continue to look at better ways to ensure a fairer allocation of spaces.
