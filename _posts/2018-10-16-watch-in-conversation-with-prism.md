The Welsh Government’s LGBTI+ network, PRISM, have created a short film as part of the Iris Prize film festival project, "[Iris Outreach](https://www.irisprize.org/outreach/)". The film, "In Conversation with PRISM" shows network members sharing their views on why being visible in the Civil Service and having allies and role models is important and helpful.

Iris Outreach is part of the [Iris Prize](https://www.irisprize.org/) family which celebrates excellence in storytelling by showcasing a selection of LGBT content from all over the world. The Iris Outreach project is funded by the Big Lottery Fund to undertake a series of new and exciting projects. Each project will take place across Wales to promote equality and diversity alongside community cohesion.
