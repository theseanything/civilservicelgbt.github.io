The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is an volunteer-led employee network for the UK Civil Service; we follows Civil Service policies and procedures.

This policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you use this website, [register as a member](/join-us) of our network, or use our services.

## What information do we collect about you?

When you register as a member of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network we collect some personal data about you. We may also collect this information when you register for our events or complete voluntary surveys. Website usage information is collected using cookies.

## How will we use the information about you?

We collect information about you so that we can:

- send you tickets to events you register for, and keep you informed about changes to event details
- send you information we think might be of interest to you about LGBT+ issues in the Civil Service through our regular newsletter
- follow up with you when you submit information to consultations or similar activities
- understand who our members are so we can plan our work to be relevant to our membership 
- improve our website and newsletters

So that we can provide you with services, we use your data when:

1. **you have given explicit consent**: we sometimes explicitly ask you to give clear, explicit consent for us to use your personal data
2. **it is in our legitimate interests**: we sometimes use your personal data when it is necessary to do so

In all cases, we use this data so that we can provide you with services or information that is relevant to you as an LGBT+ civil servant, ally or other person interested in our work, and inline with [our constitution](/about/constitution)[^lawful-basis].

[^lawful-basis]: We process this data on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union.

Where we collect sensitive personal data, like information about your sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or whether you have a disability, this is processed on the same basis[^special-cat-data].

[^special-cat-data]: We process this data on the basis of Article 9(2)(a) and 9(2)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union.

We will not share your personal information with other organisations for marketing purposes. 

We use several third party services to store and use data you provide to us, so that we can provide our services to you. These include MailChimp (for our newsletters), Eventbrite (for our events management), Typeform and SurveyMonkey (for our surveys and consultations) and Google Apps (for our email and office software).
