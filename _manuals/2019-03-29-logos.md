## About this guidance

**This guidance explains how to use Civil Service LGBT+ Network logos when producing Civil Service LGBT+ Network products.**

## Wordmark

The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** wordmark should always be displayed in the typeface Helvetica Neue in bold (font weight of 600).

## Logos

The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** logo consists of three overlapping circles -- in cyan, magenta and yellow -- with a 'multiply' filter applied. The Civil Service LGBT+ Network wordmark should be written in white in the centre of the logo.
