## About this guidance

**This guidance explains how to use colour when producing Civil Service LGBT+ Network products.**

## Use of colour

In print design, designers work with 4 base colours - cyan, magenta, yellow and black - and combine them to make all the colours they need. Our use of colour in both digital and print products is based on the same idea: it reflects our belief that many parts come together to make a better, bolder whole.

Always use the colour palette below when designing your products.

Use magenta, cyan and yellow as the primary colours, in conjunction with black or white in any products. Use red, green and purple colours if you need a wider palette.
