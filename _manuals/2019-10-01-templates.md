## About this guidance

This guidance includes links to templates for publishing content to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network website. 

These templates do not explain how to publish content; for that, [read the 'Posting new content to the website' guidance](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/manual/posting-content/).
