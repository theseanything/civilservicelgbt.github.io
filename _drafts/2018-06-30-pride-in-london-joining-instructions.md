## Meeting point and arrival times

### Collect your wristband from [INSERT] to [INSERT]

You will need a wristband to access the parade waiting area.

You can collect your wristband on Saturday morning at our meeting point at [INSERT] between [INSERT] and [INSERT].

Like last year, all participants will need to be wearing a wristband. We have been allocated a fixed number of wristbands for the Civil Service group, which will be handed out to those that have registered a place with CSRA through EventBrite.

Any wristbands that are uncollected by [INSERT] will be handed out to others so that all those that want to participate can do so.

## The Parade

### Lining up in the parade

We will move to the assembly point at [INSERT].

This year, the Civil Service is near the [INSERT] of the parade. We expect we will be moving quite quickly once the Parade starts at around midday. Please ensure you are in place before [TIME]. If you are late, you will find us in Block [INSERT].

### The route

The parade will start from [INSERT] and will go down [INSERT]. It will finish at [INSERT].

### During the parade

Remember, you are representing the Civil Service and government at this event, so you:

- must adhere to the Civil Service Code at all times
- must not promote any political messaging during the parade, or do anything that might be perceived as jeopardising your impartiality
- must not drink alcohol on the parade route

Additionally, Pride in London have asked that:

- you do not hand out stickers during the Parade
- you do not use confetti cannons, coloured smoke or throw things into the crowd
- you do not bring pets (except guide dogs) on the Parade route

## Dress code and t-shirts

You should wear suitable clothing for the event, but there is no set dress code. In the past, people have worn uniforms, but this is not essential.

T-shirts with Civil Service and Civil Service LGBT+ Network logos on are available to purchase from [INSERT]. They will be shipped in the week beginning [INSERT] direct from the supplier.

These are being printed on demand and so we will not be able to produce extras once this purchase window closes.

## After the parade: social

We will be holding post-parade drinks in the [INSERT].

If you would like to attend the post-parade social, and you aren’t registered for the Parade walking group, please ensure you are signed up to the social Eventbrite event.

## If you can no longer attend

If you can no longer attend please let us know as soon as possible by emailing [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) and cancel your place on EventBrite so that it can be offered to someone else. We have people on our waiting list – please don’t let them miss out!

Waiting list places will be allocated on [INSERT] – if you have a place allocated, you will have 24 hours to claim the place. Look out for an email in your inbox. We will continue down the waiting list until every place is claimed.
