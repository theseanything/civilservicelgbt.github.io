Today, we are publishing our annual performance report, "Delivered for you", that sets out how we performed across our objectives over the past year.

As you will see from the report, CSRA has delivered a lot including:

<ul>
<li>Working with Ben Summerskill to deliver his report for the Civil Service on the experiences of LGBT civil servants called “Don’t ask, don’t tell”.</li>
<li>Producing the first ever Civil Service wide LGBT role models guide</li>
<li>Delivering a Civil Service wide conference on LGBT issues</li>
<li>Successfully campaigning for the Civil Service to prohibit Departments from using venues that offer “gay cure therapies”</li>
<li>Participating in a record number of Pride events across the country</li>
<li>Building an effective working relationship with the Civil Service LGBT champion, Sue Owen</li>
<li>Developing the cross-departmental drinks and expanding the events across the UK</li>
<li>Growing our membership significantly and improving our website</li>
</ul>

There are some things we have not yet been able to do, such as launching our CSRA buddies scheme, but anything not yet delivered will be done as soon as possible.

You will see from the report that CSRA faces a period of uncertainty regarding its resources and capacity going into 2015/16. However, we want to reassure you that CSRA is led by a team of dedicated volunteers who are working hard to resolve this uncertainty so that CSRA can continue its important work to improve the Civil Service for LGBT staff.
