In partnership with YouGov, CSRA and a:gender have undertaken research into the experience of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* civil servants as they progress through their careers.

The Civil Service usually ranks quite highly in measures like the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, but rarely do we do in-depth research to find out why, and look for areas of improvement.

Over 800 civil servants participated in the research through a variety of online and face-to-face sessions, and YouGov also interviewed a variety of HR and diversity staff across the civil service. The final report creates a unique insight into the working conditions of LGBT civil servants across government departments.

The report also highlights several areas on which the civil service as a whole can improve its inclusivity. These include:

<ul>
<li>implementing mentoring and role models schemes</li>
<li>supporting culture change</li>
<li>providing wider training on LGBT issues</li>
<li>closing the gap between policy and practice</li>
<li>improving monitoring</li>
</ul>
