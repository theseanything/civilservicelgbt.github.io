## Publication description

Every year, we report back to you on the impact we’ve had and the progress we’ve made as an organisation. This year, we’ve achieved an incredible amount against a backdrop of significant change and a difficult environment.

Today, we’re releasing ‘Delivered for You’, our annual performance report. This report provides an honest self-assessment of what we have an have not been able to do during the past year.
