## Publication description

This is the first ever Civil Service wide role model guide that features lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other staff with a minority sexual orientation. 

This guide celebrates the positive role that LGB civil servants play across the whole Civil Service is great progress.

The guide has been created to send a clear, visible signal to all civil servants that it’s okay to be yourself in the Civil Service. It is important that everyone understands that you can be LGB and be successful in your career; that you can be LGB and be open, if you wish, about your life outside work; and that you can be LGB and be a leader.

The role models featured in this guide are from a broad range of Departments and their arm’s length bodies. Everyone featured is a volunteer, so if your Department is not featured then that is not because LGB role models do not exist within your organisation. We have also tried to reflect the diversity of the Civil Service in this guide. This means we have role models from across the grades, across locations, across job functions, and of course, across different sexual orientations – including allies.
