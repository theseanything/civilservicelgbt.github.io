You've probably heard that data protection law is changing. From 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) comes into effect.

You've also probably been contacted by dozens of groups and companies telling you that you need to do something before then. **The good news is, if you’ve previously signed up to our mailing lists, you won't need to do anything for us.**

When you signed up to our mailing list, and became a member of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network (formerly the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance), you went through a “double opt-in” process to consent to us contacting you. That means you don't need to consent again — you already did when you signed up — and you won't need to do anything to continue to receive our updates.

We’ve made a few changes to the way we run our newsletter though: instead of gathering information about you and using this to send you relevant information, we now ask you what you’re interested in hearing about. We recommend that you [update your profile](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/update-profile) so that you get the most relevant emails from us.

If you no longer want to receive emails from us, you can [unsubscribe](https://lgbt.us17.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=ff3af94531f92ff898a64d95c&id=a2cb7ebf53) at any time by clicking the link at the bottom of our emails.

We've made a few other changes to prepare for GDPR coming into effect too:

1. We've [updated our registration process](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/join-us) to minimise the amount of personal data we collect from you.
2. We've created a new way to [update the information](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/update-profile) we hold about you.
3. We've created a new [privacy and data policy](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/your-data) that explains how we use data we collect from you, and what services we use to do that.
