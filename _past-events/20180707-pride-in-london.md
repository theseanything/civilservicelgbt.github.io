Join us as we march in the parade at Pride in London.

**You must reserve a place to join the parade**. We have been allocated 120 places in the parade, and we will also have a large float as part of the event.

You can register up to 2 tickets; one for you, and one for a friend. 

To ensure all places are fairly allocated, it is not be possible to register large groups, or on behalf of an entire network as part of this process.

All places have now been filled. If you were unsuccessful in securing a ticket, you can join a waiting list. If more tickets become available, then you will be sent an email to take their place. You will have 24 hours to respond before your place is allocated to the next person on the list.

All reservations also allow you to attend our post-parade social. The venue for this is still to be confirmed.
