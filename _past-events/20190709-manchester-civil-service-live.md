Our Manchester local organisers will be at Civil service Live in Manchester representing the network this year. 

Members of the North West Team  will be joining forces with [a:gender](//www.agender.org.uk) for stall on the day. Pop along and say 'hello'.

If you're in town after, our Manchester Civil Service LGBT + social is also on the same evening at The Goose on Bloom Street M31 3JE from 6 â€“ 9pm. Meet other LGBT+ colleagues from various departments across government in a social setting. 

Please email <northwest@civilservice.lgbt> if you would like a buddy to meet you if you are alone in town or if your not sure where to go  we are happy to help.
