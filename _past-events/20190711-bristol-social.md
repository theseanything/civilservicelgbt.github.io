Join us for a networking and social event to coincide with Bristol Pride Week. This event is your chance to meet other LGBT+ civil servants from across government. Anyone can attend, so long as you work for a Civil Service organisation. It’s usually free to attend.

To make sure as many people can get involved as possible, we launched a questionnaire at the beginning of May to find out what our you would like to see in the South West. Here are the main things we found…

1. You’d like to meet on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays
2. The second week of the month works best for more people
3. You’d like to meet at an LGBT or LGBT+ friendly venue around Cabot Circus and Old Market

To re-launch our South West events, we will be having our next social during Bristol Pride week on Thursday 11 July 2019 at The Phoenix. Your regional organisers, Andrew Cowler from Ofsted and Katharine Sendell from the Cabinet Office will be there from 5pm to greet you – and hopefully we’ll be able to sit in the garden if the weather is good. If you’re worried about coming along on your own, you can bring a colleague because allies are always welcome or [get in contact with us](southwest@civilservice.lgbt) if you’d like to meet us beforehand.

The questionnaire will stay open so that even more people can tell us what they want and we can keep adapting to what’s best for you. If you haven’t already had your say, [complete the survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nScIp4jeYkuVYIWmvowIzFDh8q-FHORFrjJvXGTirHZUREoxWDRXSU1WUDFQS0xDNjFDR0g5OTBQNy4u) and feel free to share it with other civil servants in the region.

Remember to [join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2409606785735978/) for all the latest updates and events in the South West.

**Not based in Bristol?** Don’t worry, we also hold events in other parts of the UK too. You can find all our events on our website.

If we don’t have an event coming up in your area, why not run one yourself! Contact us and we can help you promote it.
