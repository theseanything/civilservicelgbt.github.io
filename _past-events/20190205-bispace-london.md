BiSpace -- our initiative led by bi+ civil servants, for bi+ civil servants -- is back. These regular events are a chance for bi, pan and queer civil servants to meet each other in both formal and more informal settings. 

To celebrate LGBT History Month, we're holding 3 BiSpace events in Bristol, London, and Manchester.

## BiSpace London

This will be a chilled “Lunch and Learn” style event where you can celebrate LGBT History Month, meet fellow bi/pan/queer civil servants and take part in some informal facilitated sessions. 

Feel free to bring along your lunch! Find our more and sign up [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bispace-london-tickets-54671579165) to make sure you’re on the list.
